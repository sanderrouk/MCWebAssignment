# MCWebAssignment
This test assignment was assigned to me by Mooncascade in order to test my capabilities regarding web application development.

### Languages used: 
* Java 8
* Javascript ECMAScript 6 but nothing specific to 6 was used.
* HTML 5
* CSS

### Frameworks used:
* Spring
* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* AngularJS 1.4.0

### Additional info:
The project uses Gradle as the build tool so it easily builds using the gradle wrapper. The database engine it uses is H2 because it is a local db and ties well with Spring.

### What this project demonstrates:
My ability to create a RESTful api and a backend framework with Java and Spring boot. My ability to create a frontend using a js framework such as AngularJS to work with that RESTful api.
